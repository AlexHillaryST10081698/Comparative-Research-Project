# Research Project
# this project contains to seperate models which is used to draw comparisson
# the 2 seperate models is a Machine Learning XGboost model and a Deep Lerning RNN model

# The project was created in Jupiter Notebook using version 6.5.4

# ABout Datset
# The Dataset can be found ----> https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhavikjikadara/retail-transactional-dataset 
# Contains over 3000 000 records 
# Contains information regarding customers purchasing behaviours (demographic data, temporial data)
# Contains over 30 columns/ features

# Goals for both model (ML model of XGBoost models and DL model of RNN)
# To idetify which model yeilds greater acuuracy
# Whch model handles bigger amounts of data better
# To identifying which approach offers clearer insights into the factors driving predictions.
